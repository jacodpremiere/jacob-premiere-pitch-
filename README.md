# Jacob Premiere – The Global Home Cinema Revolution

Jacob Premiere is building the world's first decentralized, secure, and immersive cinematic platform that brings theatrical movie releases directly into homes. Our system integrates real-time legal agreements, anti-piracy protection, and immersive viewing experiences, redefining film distribution for the digital age.

## 🎬 What This Repo Contains
This is the official landing page of Jacob Premiere, featuring:

- A confidentiality access form powered by **Zoho Forms**.
- Legal onboarding for early-stage collaborators and stakeholders.
- HTML-only structure, hosted via **GitHub Pages**.

## 💡 Project Vision
We believe that movie distribution should empower filmmakers, protect creative assets, and offer viewers a premium at-home experience. Jacob Premiere combines blockchain, DRM technology, and AI dubbing to unlock global theatrical premieres without the physical cinema.
